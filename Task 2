Teaching “Machine Learning” to Middle School Students Using Different Prompting Techniques

1. Zero-Shot Prompt

Prompt:
"Explain Machine Learning in simple words for middle school students, using a fun example (under 150 words)."
Sample Answer:
Machine Learning is when a computer learns from examples instead of rules. Show it many cat and dog pictures, and it figures out how to tell them apart, like a student learning from practice.



2. Few-Shot Prompt

Prompt:
"Examples:

Gravity: ‘Gravity is like an invisible hand that pulls everything down.’

Photosynthesis: ‘Plants make food using sunlight, like tiny solar panels.’
Now, explain Machine Learning in the same style (under 100 words)."
Sample Answer:
Machine Learning is like training a dog, but the dog is a computer. We give it many examples, like cat and dog photos, and it practices until it can tell the difference.


3. Chain-of-Thought Prompt

Prompt:
"Step by step, explain Machine Learning to middle schoolers:

1. What they know


2. Small parts


3. Simple example


4. Why it matters (150 words)."
Sample Answer:
Students know games and pets. Machine Learning is when computers practice with examples instead of rules. It learns patterns—like spotting cats and dogs—and helps apps, games, and robots become smarter.


4. Tree-of-Thought Prompt

Prompt:
"Give 3 ways to explain Machine Learning (game, animal, school). Pick the best and write it (120 words)."
Sample Answer:
Best: Animal training. Machine Learning is like training a puppy, but the puppy is a computer. We show it examples, and it learns patterns, like recognizing animals in photos.


5. Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Prompt

Prompt:
"Explain Machine Learning with a diagram idea and short text (80 words)."
Sample Answer:
Diagram: Computer + arrows from “Cat photos” and “Dog photos” → Lightbulb (“Learning”) → “Answer: Cat or Dog?”
Text: The computer studies examples, finds patterns, and learns to tell things apart. More practice makes it smarter.
